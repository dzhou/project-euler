"Project Euler exists to encourage, challenge, and develop the skills 
and enjoyment of anyone with an interest in the fascinating world of 
mathematics." 

-- from projecteuler.net 


My purposes for publishing my solutions on github are:
1. Share my solutions with people who have trouble with any of 
    these PE problems. 
2. Demonstrate the power of python!

Why Python for Project Euler:
1. Built-in big integer 
2. Arbitrary precision decimal 
3. Interpreted and dynamic, fast for prototype
4 ..

ProjectEuler requires you to solve the problem in order to see the forum 
(and other people's solutions). This does makes a lot of sense but it 
can also be frustrating for people who are stuck on a problem (or a 
series of problems based on similiar premise/topic). Given the diverse 
topics (across multiple branches of mathematics and computer science), 
it's realistic to say that very few people have the knowledge to solve 
all the problems. When someone is stuck on a problem for days and is 
making no progress, I think it's better for them to look at (and 
study/learn) someone else's solution rather than give up completely. 

I recommend taking a look at the common functions first. For example, 
having efficient primality test or integer factorization will get you 
half way on many PE problems.
